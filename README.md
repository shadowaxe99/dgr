# Ultimate Code Interpreter

This project is an ultimate code interpreter that combines the power of GPT-based language models with a code execution engine. It allows users to interact with the code interpreter through a user-friendly interface.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Ultimate Code Interpreter consists of the following components:

- `ultimate_code_interpreter.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the code interpreter and defines the chat to code bot.

- `open_interpreter.py`: This module contains the `CodeInterpreter` class, which is responsible for executing the code.

- `gpt_code_ui.py`: This module contains the `process_text` function, which processes the input text using the GPT model.

- `gpt-code-ui/README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the GPT Code UI project.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required to run the project.

## Usage

To use the Ultimate Code Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Start the application by running `python ultimate_code_interpreter.py`.

3. Access the user interface in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
